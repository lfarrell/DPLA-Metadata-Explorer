        <p>Metadata Explorer is an attempt to explore national and pan-national digtial libraries in a different, hopefully
            useful way. Use Metadata Explorer to search the DPLA, Europeana or Digital New Zealand for a term or terms and view the metadata associated with your search.
            The metadata is shown as a force directed text cloud.</p>
        <p>Double click within the graph
        to zoom in further. Use your scroll wheel to pan back out. Drag the visualization to move around in it.
            Hover over a text bubble to view info about it. Click a text
        bubble to search the selected provider for your original term plus the clicked metadata field.</p>
        <p>The metadata fields returned vary slightly by provider based on which fields can be returned as facet counts.
            This was done to reduce API calls to the providers.</p>
        <p>I also plan to add Trove to the list of searchable digital libraries at some point.</p>
        <p>Metadata Explorer works best in Webkit browsers such as Chrome and Safari. It should also work pretty well in
        FireFox.</p>
